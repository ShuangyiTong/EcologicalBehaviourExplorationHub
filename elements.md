<h2 id="content">Multi-Armed Bandit Tasks</h2>
<p>This is the code used for the simulations and analysis in the paper 'Enhancing Experimental Design through Bayes Factor Design Analysis: Insights from Multi-Armed Bandit Tasks'. 
The pipeline simulates behavioural data from a two-armed bandit task, after which estimates of the exploration parameter and differences in exploration between groups are analysed.
A design analysis using Bayes Factor was conducted to examine the correlation between sample size and the strength of evidence for a difference in exploration between two groups. This analysis considers the likelihood of substantial evidence for an incorrect hypothesis and the likelihood of insufficient evidence for the correct hypothesis.</p>

<h2 id="content">Safety-Efficiency Trade off</h2>
<p>The code accompanying our manuscript: Balancing safety and efficiency in human decision making (https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/101371)

Gridworld results can be obtained by running multiple_runs.py in GridWorlds/multiple_runs/.

Model-fitting scripts are provided in the folder FishVRTask, which can be run either in Python using PyStan or in R using Stan. Codes for running it within the hBayesDM package are also provided, please follow: https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM/wiki/How-to-add-new-model to run within hBayesDM.

<h2 id="content">Immersive free-operant foraging VR task</h2>
<p>Foraging theory is a broad and well-studied subject within animal behaviour research. Various foraging study paradigms have been established in both laboratory and natural environments. A natural foraging task, while simple for a healthy human to perform, encapsulates key components relevant to pain research. Firstly, foraging is goal-directed; subjects actively search for food under varying levels of motivation, allowing for the examination of the interaction between motivation and pain. Secondly, a natural foraging task involves full-body movement. Given that many types of pain are closely linked to movement and exercise, motion capture technology—a fundamental component of immersive VR—allows for precise recording and analysis of movement under different pain conditions. Finally, foraging involves exploring the environment and learning an optimal strategy to maximize rewards, naturally linking pain to cognitive functions. Motivated by these considerations, we designed the free-operant foraging task aimed at simulating realistic foraging behaviours. At the beginning of each block, virtual pineapples of varying heights from 0.33 to 1 were generated within the virtual space. Five identical baskets were placed within the space. Spatial locations of trees and vegetation were generated using the game engine’s default tree painting tool.
